How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

A thorough planning stage, where a clearly defined set of functional requirements is created is vital to the end product being viable. 
Adhering to best practices such as the principle of least priveledge will serve to make the program itself secure.
Thorough testing will ensure that the application functions as intended.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Translating the user's needs into functional requirements in order to delineate the specific tasks the program is meant to perform. 
Once the requirements have been established, breaking each requirement down into individual components and working on implementing each component.
Test early and often to ensure that these systems are adhering to the purpose of the program.


How do I approach designing software?

Start by defining clear goals and requirements based on user needs.
Choose a pattern, break down the system into key components, and consider appropriate data structures.
Establish a basic functioning version of the program, continue to iterate upon it to add functionalities or enhance efficiency.
